[*The Feynman Lectures on Physics*](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/) is a physics textbook based on some lectures by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman). The lectures were presented before undergraduate students at the [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/), during 1961–1963. The book's co-authors are Feynman, [Robert B.

## Chapter 1. Atoms in Motion

### 1–2 Matter is made of atoms

If there is a cataclysm in the world, how can we convey the most information about this world to the next generation in the fewest words?

When they are close, they will repel each other, and when they are far away from each other, they will attract each other.

## Chapter 2. Basic Physics
