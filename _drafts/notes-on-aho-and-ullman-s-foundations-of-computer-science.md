[Alfred Vaino Aho](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~aho/) (1941) is a Canadian computer scientist best known for his work on programming languages, compilers, and related algorithms, and his textbooks on the art and science of computer programming. He and his long-time collaborator [Jeffrey Ullman](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/) (1942) are the recipients of the 2020 Turing Award. Their book [*Foundations of Computer Science*](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html) was developed from notes for a two-quarter course called CS109: Introduction to Computer Science at Stanford. The book was first published in 1992, and the chosen language of the example programs was Pascal. The second edition was published in 1994, and the chosen language was replaced by C. The content of this book covers discrete mathematics and data structures.

## Chapter 1. Computer Science: The Mechanization of Abstraction

### 1.1 What This Book Is About

This book uses C to teach the principles of computer science, and emphasizes three important problem-solving tools:

1. *Data models*, the abstractions used to describe problems.
2. *Data structures*, the programming-language constructs used to represent data models.
3. *Algorithms*, the techniques used to obtain solutions by manipulating data as represented by the abstractions of a data model, by data structures, or by other means.

A data model refers to the abstraction at the mathematical level, while a data structure refers to a programming language's representation of a data model.

### 1.5 Algorithms and the Design of Programs
