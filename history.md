Ladybridge Singers have been very active in recent years, giving up to 15 performances per season.  We have shared  concerts with other prominent choirs and music groups in the area, and with Flint Male Voice Choir.

We hold many testimonials from organisations we have entertained, an extract of which follows:

>A range of songs, sacred and secular were performed by the Ladybridge Singers, much to the delight of the audience.  Over Â£188 was raised for GIVE through the sale of tickets, and donations.
>
>The choir were poised, and followed every direction of the conductor utilising a range of dynamics, but always ensuring their diction was perfect.  It is rare  to hear so many words as clearly as we did that evening.  We enjoyed Rutter's 'All things bright and beautiful'' and 'Look at the World', the theme tune to the Vicar of Dibley - 'The 23rd Psalm, The lord is my  Shepherd', songs from New Zealand,  the Isle Of Man, Scottish airs, and a classic 'Praise God' by Mozart.
>
>The choir should be congratulated on their sense of rhythm, the preciseness and crispness with which they performed 'Cantate Rag' by Clive Sansom, and 'Gonna build a Mountain'.  The latter was a negro spiritual sung with feeling, but the Cantate surprisingly, turned out to have all the hallmarks of a rock and roll riff, as  we swayed to the familiar bass line.
>
>The audience thoroughly enjoyed the medley of songs from 'Les Miserables' although eyes misted at the sentiments of the songs.  Hearts were stirred by well known tunes like 'Some Enchanted Evening', 'Perhaps Love', and 'Softly as I Leave You'.  Finally, we were encouraged to join in the last collection of songs, taken from the days of the Music Hall.  Toes were tapping and our voices swelled with confidence as one chorus was followed by another, equally well known.
