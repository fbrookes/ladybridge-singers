<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Gala Concert</h2>
The 24th June was this year's Gala Concert at Horwich Parish Church. It was supported again by the Mayor and Mayoress of Horwich, and the Mayor of Bolton, and two representatives from Hearing Dogs for the Deaf. 
  
This concert has proved very popular over the last few years, the choir sang at its best to a very large and appreciative audience. We sang a mixture of songs including some choral pieces, and songs from the shows, and also a new piece by Joanna Forbes L'Estrange which was written for the Coronation.

Many thanks to the soloists  Bernadette, for a clarinet solo, Maurice Rushby, a very fine bass singer, two very taleted young pianists, and a Euphonium solo from James Bainton

The children from Horwich Parish CofE school entertained us once again singing and playing their violins and guitars

The event raised the magnificent sum of Â£2500, which was donated to The Hearing Dogs for the Deaf.
