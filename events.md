The 25th June was this years Gala Concert at Horwich Parish Church. It was supported again by the Mayors and Mayoress of Boton and Horwich, the MP Chris Green, and     a representative from Bolton Hospice.
  
This concert has proved very popular over the last few years, the choir sang at it's best to a very large and appreciative audience.  We sang a mixture of songs including some new pieces to us from Les Miserable, and a medley of Abba songs, which went down very well.

Many thanks to the soloists Kathryn, Bernadette, Harry and Alan for their contribution, not forgetting the extremely talented violinist James Warburton, who has played with us many times.

The children from Horwich Parish CofE school were a delight singing a variety of songs including 'T Rex Rock' which set our feet tapping.

The event raised the magnificent sum of £1885, which was increased from choir funds to £2000, and was donated to the Bolton Hospice.
