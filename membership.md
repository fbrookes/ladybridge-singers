The choir rehearses at St Helens Road Methodist Church, Bolton, each Monday evening between 7.15 and 9.30 pm. Our rehearsal season starts in early September and finishes at the end of June the following year. Our concert season begins in October each year and also finishes at the end of June.

We normally welcome everyone who wishes to join us. However there may occasionally be restrictions depending on the current balance between sopranos and contraltos, and tenors and bass. Though helpful, you don't need to read music, and all new members undertake a very short (and private) audition after a trial period of four weeks.  Membership fees are currently Â£45 per season.

Membership enquiries should be directed to the choir secretary Freda Brookes on 01204 841431, or [freda.brookes@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:freda.brookes@yahoo.co.uk)
